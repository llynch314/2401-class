Creating an SSH key pair for GitHub:
    1. In your terminal run:
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    2. Run:
        ls .ssh/
            * This should show at least 2 files, one called id_ed25519 and one called id_ed25519.pub
    3. Run:
        cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub
            * MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE .pub
            * This should show a string that starts with "ssh_ed25519" and ends with your email.
    4. Copy the text from the id_25519.pub file.
    5. On GitHub:
        1. Log in to your account.
        2. Find the "Settings" menu
        3. On the left sidebar, you should see "SSH and GPG keys"
        4. Click the green box that says "New SSH Key"
        5. Give the key a name (I usually put something that describes the machine it is for)
        6. Paste the id_ed25519.pub contents in the box marked "Key"
        7. Save
    6. Remember that for the key to work, you will need to clone with the SSH url from now on.



Git Commands:

git clone <repo url>
    * Use the SSH option for the URL if you want to authenticate with a key instead of token.

git status

git add <something>
    * A file name or "." to add all pending changes

git status 

git commit -m "message"
    * Remember to add "run-tests" if you want the automated tests to run when you push to GitHub

git push
